This website will be dedicated to my Portfolio and Computer interests

and cover the topics of Programming, Graphic Design, and Hardware & Software. The audience will

be Clients and Potential Employers. I will be adding 

posts every 1 week about programming discoveries or some new artwork. 

I am doing this because I'd like to represent my work online and have a portfolio for employers.
